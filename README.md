# Halogen Game Engine 

The Halogen Game Engine is a personal hobby project aimed at building a simple, robust game engine using C++, OpenGL, GLFW, and ImGui. This engine is designed with simplicity in mind, with a focus on providing a foundation for game development learning and exploration.

## Project Description

Halogen Game Engine is a cross-platform engine for Windows (support for other platforms might be considered in the future). The engine uses modern OpenGL for rendering and GLFW for window handling and input. Additionally, it uses ImGui to provide a customizable, developer-friendly GUI.

The engine is in its initial development phase, and many features are still under construction. The roadmap includes features like:

- [ ] A robust rendering pipeline using modern OpenGL techniques.
- [ ] Input handling using GLFW.
- [ ] Integration of ImGui for engine's GUI.
- [ ] 3D Mathematics for transformations and lighting.
- [ ] Model loading using Assimp (or similar).
- [ ] Basic physics and collision detection.
- [ ] Sound handling.

And many more...
(or not if i forget about this)

## Contribution

As a hobby project, Halogen Game Engine is very open to contributions! Whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, or proposing new features, your pull requests are welcomed and appreciated.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this engine is developed primarily as a learning tool by a hobbyist developer. While it aims to provide a robust set of features, it might not be suitable for large scale, professional game development (yet!).
